# Grund 
## TLDR
You're free to use this if your brain is the size of a wall bust.
Variables are scoped and global, and the standard library is pretty bad; you are welcome.
Its syntax is python c# like. 
I will soon write documentation.
Anyway, I will release the compiled version soon if anyone actually wants to use this burning plastic.
It can compile to exe. 

## Syntax:
1. All variables do not require type referencing; for example, x = 1 is an integer.
2. All key words, such as "WHILE," "IF," "FUNK," "END," and so on, must be capitalized.
