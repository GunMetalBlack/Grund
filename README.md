# Grund 
## TLDR
You're free to use this if your brain is the size of a wall bust.
All variables are scoped and global, and the standard library does exist; you are welcome.
Lists are functions...
Its syntax is "all caps, have fun."
I will soon write documentation.
Anyway, I will release the compiled version soon if anyone actually wants to use this burning plastic.
  
## Syntax:
1. All variables do not require type referencing; for example, x = 1 is an integer.
2. All key words, such as "while," "if," "funk," "end," and so on, must be capitalized.
