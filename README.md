# Grund 
## TLDR
You're free to use this if your brain is the size of a wall bust.
Variables are scoped and global, and the standard library is pretty bad; you are welcome.
Its syntax is python c# like. 
I will soon write documentation.
Anyway, I will release the compiled version soon if anyone actually wants to use this burning plastic.
It can compile to exe. 

## Run Instructions
After installation, enter your friendly neighborhood command prompt and enter the following command.
Make sure the file you pass in has the .grd file extension.

``` .\grund somefile.grd ```
You can chain files together to combine mutiple scripts by enter the following command

``` .\grund somefile.grd someother.grd test.grd ```
