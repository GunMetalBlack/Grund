# Grund 
## TLDR
You're free to use this if your brain is the size of a wall bust.
Variables are scoped and global, and the standard library is pretty bad; you are welcome.
Its syntax is python c# like. 
I will soon write documentation.
Anyway, I will release the compiled version soon if anyone actually wants to use this burning plastic.
It can compile to exe. 

## Run Instructions
Make sure the file you're sending has the.grd extension. 
After installation, enter your friendly neighborhood command prompt and make sure your in the directory of the installation enter the following command:

``` .\grund somefile.grd ```
You can chain files together to combine mutiple scripts by enter the following command

``` .\grund somefile.grd someother.grd test.grd ```
